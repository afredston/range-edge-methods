# TABLE A1. A table summarizing the associations and findings for all 254 avian species considered in the analysis. For each species, the migratory status (Migratory) and the center of each species winter range is indicated (N/S). Migratory status was determined based on examinations of winter and breeding distribution maps. The location of the center of the range was determined based on the average latitude of CBC circles in 1975 using 36ยบ north latitude as the demarcation. In addition, the number of CBC circles is indicated where each species was designated as common (COM), common and extirpated (EXT), common and colonized (COL), and the number of CBC circles where the species was present but not identified in any of the three common categories (NCOM). These values were estimated based on an analysis of temporal turnover dynamics (see the text for details on the analysis and description of categories). Finally, slope coefficients from individual linear models are presented for each species that estimate latitudinal trends for the northern boundary (NB), center of occurrence (CO), and center of abundance (CA) of geographic ranges (see text for description of linear models and range components).
